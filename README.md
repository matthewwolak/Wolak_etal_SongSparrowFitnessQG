This repository contains a version controlled and editable source for the data and code used in the quantitative genetic analyses of Mandarte Island song sparrow fitness and fitness components that are the basis for the manuscript titled above and published in *Evolution* (doi: [https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13575)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/evo.13575).

### Data

These data come from the long-term song sparrow field study on Mandarte Island, BC, Canada.

The data provided here are sufficient to replicate the analyses presented in the above paper, and are therefore a restricted subset of the full Mandarte dataset.

If you are interested in running additional analyses that require further data then please get in touch with at least one (preferably all) of the following project leaders:
  - Prof. Peter Arcese (University of British Columbia): peter.arcese{at}ubc.ca
  - Prof. Lukas Keller (University of Zurich): lukas.keller{at}ieu.uzh.ch
  - Prof. Jane Reid (University of Aberdeen): jane.reid{at}abdn.ac.uk

We are always happy to develop collaborations with researchers who have good ideas for new analyses.

We would also appreciate it if you could let us know if you are intending to make use of the dataset below in order to facilitate coordination of different ongoing research efforts and allow us to keep track of all outputs from the long-term field study.
